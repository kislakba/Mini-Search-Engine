  an investigation of transition and skin friction on an insulated
flat plate , by in , was made in the galcit  by in.
hypersonic wind tunnel at a nominal mach number of .
  the phosphorescent lacquer technique was used for transition
detection and was found to be in good agreement with total head
rake measurements along the plate surface and pitot boundarylayer
surveys .  it was found that the boundary layer was
laminar at reynolds numbers of at least .  transverse
contamination caused by the turbulent boundary layer on the
tunnel sidewall originated far downstream of the flat plate leading
edge at reynolds numbers of to , and spread at a
uniform angle of compared to degree in low speed flow .
  the effect of two dimensional and local disturbances was investigated
.  the technique of air injection into the boundary
layer as a means of hastening transition was extensively used .
although the onset of transition occurred at reynolds numbers
as low as , a fully developed turbulent boundary layer was
not obtained at reynolds numbers much below regardless
of the amount of air injected .
  a qualitative discussion of these results is given with emphasis
on the possibility of a greater stability of the laminar boundary
layer in hypersonic flow than at lower speeds .
  direct skin friction measurements were made by means of the
floating element technique , over a range of reynolds numbers
verified as being laminar over the complete range .  with air
injection , turbulent shear was obtained only for reynolds numbers
greater than , this value being in good agreement with
earlier results of this investigation .  the turbulent skin friction
coefficient was found to be approximately of that for incompressible
flow for a constant value of , and for an effective
reynolds number between and .
